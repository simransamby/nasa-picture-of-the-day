            <h3>We reach for new heights and reveal the
                <br>unknown for the benefit of humankind</h3>
            <h4>NASA Open Source Development</h4>
            <p>NASA continues to expand opportunities for the public to interact and engage with its missions and initiatives.
                NASA is a leader in the use of challenges and prize competitions within the federal government. We believe
                in the power of open innovation, specifically through incentive prizes, challenges, crowd-sourcing, and citizen
                science, to help address those problems in partnership with innovators from around the country and the globe.
                We seek to get the public involved in their space program and are creating opportunities regularly for broad
                engagement through our prizes, challenges and crowd-sourcing activities. To continue, encourage, and highlight
                NASA open source activities, NASA continues to maintain a public repository on a popular web-based social
                code and revision control application. Integrated into our teamâ€™s core mission, we are actively reaching
                out to software projects within NASA and encouraging them to make use of this and similar resources for publishing
                open source. We hope that highly visible and coordinated hosting of activities will stimulate development
                and awareness and make the platform the default repository for new open source software releases.</p>
